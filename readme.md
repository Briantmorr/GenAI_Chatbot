# Getting Started
## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing an advanced generative chatbot using state-of-the-art architectures and techniques. The chatbot is capable of carrying out multi-turn conversations, adapting to context, and handling a variety of topics.

## Project Goal
- Objective: Build a generative chatbot that can engage in coherent and context-aware conversations with users.
- Output: A working chatbot accessible via a Jupyter Notebook and a web interface.

## Dataset
- Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD): A comprehensive dataset consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, paired with the corresponding answers in the text.
